//Loops.........
// -> Loops = A loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
//    This helps avoid writing the same code again and again.

// ->  Types of Loops in Java
// 1. for loop = Used when the number of iterations is known
// 2. while loop = Used when the number of iterations is not fixed (condition-based).
// 3. do-while loop = Similar to while, but executes the code at least once before checking the condition.

/* -> formula of complete last digit
   -> note => last digit = num % 10;
   -> note => remove last digit = num = num / 10;
   -> note => reverse = (reverse * 10) + last digit
